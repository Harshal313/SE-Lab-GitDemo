                <p>Photography is an art of observation. It has little to do with the things one sees and everything to
                    do with the way they see it. Do you think you have the sight of keen observation? If yes, surprise
                    us with your images by participating in the categories that suit you the best. No restrictions on
                    the number of categories you want to participate in!
